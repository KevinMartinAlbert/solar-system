# The solar system

Here is my first attempt at recreating the solar system and my first project with three.js.

I started this project with the intention of learning three.js so I have been very minimalistic with the code structure and soon realized that the solar system is complex. I'll probably make a much cleaner version in a few months including the planetary systems, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the ISS and more, there are lots of stuff flying around.

## potentia ideas for next version

- think things first and model a class diagram with plantUML before coding. the solar system and 3D get complex very quickly
- abstract class for systems => class for solar system, class for planetary system
- abstract class for star => sun, terrestrial planet, gas giant, moons, rings, satellites
- camera class for better handling of points of views
- array cam for virtual reality
- light class for light creation and management (reflection, radiosity)

...

- spend more time on CSS ? ... // _Sitcom laugh tracks_ //

## thanks

Thanks to Wael Yasmina for the boilerplate he provided.
